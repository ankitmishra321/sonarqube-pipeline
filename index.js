// Deprecated: legacy JS entry retained for reference only.
// Project now uses TypeScript sources under `src/`.
// Start the app with `npm run dev` (TypeScript) or build with `npm run build` then `npm start`.

/*
  The real server entry is at `src/index.ts` and the Express app is exported from
  `src/app.ts` to make the code testable (see `tests/app.test.ts`).
